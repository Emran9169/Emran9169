Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a background in computer engineering. Here are some of my notable projects:

### Retail Customer Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting retail customer behavior using machine learning techniques. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using Python and various machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and NLTK.

### ML Project Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive unsupervised learning project aimed at segmenting wholesale customers based on their annual spending in various product categories. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and clustering algorithms.

### ML Project Supervised Learning

This repository includes a supervised learning project designed to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The project involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, and training a machine learning model.

### Tableau Project

The objective of this project was to use Tableau's capabilities to analyze and illustrate the FIFA 2018 dataset to provide insightful information on player performances and valuations. The project identifies significant patterns in player attributes, determines the correlation between these attributes and player market prices, and provides football scouts and managers with useful insights.

### Statistical Modelling Project

This project aims to analyze bike-sharing data in New York City using the CityBikes, Foursquare, and Yelp APIs. The primary goals include understanding the distribution and utilization of bike-sharing stations, comparing the data quality of the APIs regarding local points of interest (POIs), and building a statistical model to explore the relationship between bike availability and the characteristics of nearby POIs.

### MySQL Project

The main objective of this project is to achieve a clean and well-organized dataset with reliable data integrity using SQL. The project involves data cleaning to eliminate unnecessary, bulky, missing values, and inconsistencies, and executing a thorough Quality Assurance (QA) process to validate the cleaned data against the original dataset.

### Cryptocurrency Market Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing historical data of the top cryptocurrencies to uncover market trends and predict future price movements. Our aim is to derive meaningful insights from the data and provide a comprehensive understanding of the cryptocurrency market dynamics. This is a group project involving two members, and we analyzed btc, eth, xrp, ada, and bnb using data from the Bitfinex exchange from 2018 to 2023.
